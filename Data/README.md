# SOCR Earthquake Data

For this project, we chose to use the [SOCR Earthquake Data](http://socr.ucla.edu/docs/resources/SOCR_Data/SOCR_Data_Earthquakes_Over3.html) to train and evaluate our proposed method and the comparative methods.

## Dataset Details

- Date & Time (UTC)- The date and time the earthquake occurred. All time in the earthquake catalog is referenced to UTC.
- Latitude & Longitude (Deg) - The geo-location of the earthquake's epicentre.
- Depth (km) - The depth of the earthquake.
- Magnitude (ergs) -
- Magnitude Type - 
- Number of Stations - Number of stations used to measure the data.
- Gap - The azimuthal gap.
- Close - The distance of the closest station from the epicentre.
- RMS - The root-mean-squared residual of solution.
- Source - The entity that gathered / curated the data.
- EventID - The unique ID for the event.
